# Sales Data Analysis

Introduction:

In this repository, I extensively utilized Python's Pandas package for data analysis and employed a variety of data visualization techniques to effectively communicate key findings and actionable recommendations on a dataset which related to sales.

Objective:

The main objective of this project was to derive useful insights from sales data to enhance productivity, inform better decision-making, and ultimately improve client experiences.

Key Responsibilities:

• Data Cleaning: Ensured dataset integrity by resolving missing values,negative values and outliers, preparing the data for in-depth analysis.

• Data Analysis: Performed detailed analysis on key performance metrics such as net sales amount and quantity.

• Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib to create clear, insightful visualizations that facilitated understanding of key findings.

• Recommendation Generation: Delivered strategic, data-driven recommendations aimed at optimizing operations and improving performance across key areas.

Tools and Technologies:

• Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

• Google colab for coding.
